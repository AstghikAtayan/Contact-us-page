Is this code works for you? :)
It is very important in case of errors debug code, it will help find out issues quickly
I have added some comments in the code
Also you did not use logging in your framework
And please kee pages, testdata files, test files in separet folders. It make structure more readable

Overall already closer to POM structure, a bit more practise, time and attention and everything will be ok!!!
